# FitnessInspire

RWCA - Hackathon App

RWCA Hosted its summer 17 Hackathon and the prompt was to create an app in Health and Fitness.
The time given to complete this project was 6 hours.

Inspire is created to help people start a healthier lifestyle. The app provides links to the best fitness apps, as well as dietary sites. 
Inspire is here to motivate, the quotes page has a random quote generator, quotes from athletes and famous figures.
